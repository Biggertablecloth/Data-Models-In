## Additional Guidelines
Please try to fill all cells. Blank or null values may indicate incompleteness. Use “NA” if data does not exist for this field. Use “Unspecified” if data is asked for but not provided by source (such as gender and ethnicity, which employees may not wish to disclose). 

Please enter all dates with full years. Two-digit years will not validate. 

PO Boxes for location addresses will resolve, however they are strongly discouraged. Please use them if and only if no other options are available and they are representative of the actual address we are asking for (i.e. they are in the same zip code or neighborhood). If no suitable options are available, please use “NA.”
Termination dates should be left blank if the employee has not yet been terminated. If an employee had been terminated after the date range of this report, leaving in the date of termination will not cause a problem for us however if you wish to delete it you may.
