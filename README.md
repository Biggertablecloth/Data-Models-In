Tablecloth Data Models Documentation

The directories in this repository contain different data models Tablecloth uses for gathering data from companies who wish to measure their ESG impact. ESG stands for Environmental, Social and Governance and is used by investors to determine how good companies are for the world. With these modesl Tablecloth runs calculations and track changes over time. We provide these services to the financial sector. You can learn more at Tablecloth.io. 

Follow this repository to track changes to our input models (i.e. the data we ask our clients to provide). 

If you are a client then you can use these models as guides in your internal efforts to collect data.
